# Lottery_game

This code is a Python class that simulates playing the lottery. The class has several variables that can be set by the user, such as the cost of a ticket, the odds of winning, the value of the jackpot, and the number of weeks to simulate. The class has methods to run the simulation and play the lottery, and it returns a summary of the simulation.

The code also includes a loop that simulates playing the lottery 1,000,000 times, each for 52 weeks, and tracks the amount of money spent and won each year, as well as the net profit. The net profit, money spent, and money won are plotted on a graph and saved as an image file.
